# scallyword-cli
Word game coded in go


This is a variation of wordle. The program randomly selects a six letter word and you are required to guess anrandomly selected four letter word
that can be built from the letters of the six letter word. You have three guesses and the program reports which letters you get correct or incorrect
with each guess to help with the next guess. 

Written in Go to learn the language. I originally wrote this in Nim and ported it over.
